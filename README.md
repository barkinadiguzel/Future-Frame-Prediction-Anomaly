# Future-Frame-Prediction-Anomaly
Future Frame Prediction for Anomaly Detection is an unsupervised approach where a model is trained to predict the next video frame using only normal events. When an abnormal event occurs, it becomes unpredictable, causing a large difference between the predicted frame and the ground truth, which is used as the anomaly signal.
